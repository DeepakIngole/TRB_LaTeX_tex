# TRB_LaTeX_tex
A LaTeX template for Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting papers

This is a lighter version of the former TRB LaTeX template (https://github.com/chiehrosswang/TRB_LaTeX_rnw).  The previous version was built primarily for people using R, Sweave, and LaTeX.  A few people requested a light version because they may not need/know how to use Sweave.  Therefore, this version (TRB_LaTeX_tex) is created for people just need a straight-forward LaTeX template for TRB papers.
